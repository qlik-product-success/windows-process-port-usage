.SYNOPSIS
    Get snapshot of TCP port usage for all current Windows processes 
.DESCRIPTION
    This script gets current running processes and open TCP connections.
    The aggregated result is stored into a CSV files, which can be consumed into Qlik Sense for analysis
.NOTES
    This script should be run on regular interval through scheduled Windows taks to collect port allocaiton details over time. 
    Default output is to C:\Temp, but this can be altered through OutputFolder variable.
#>
 
# Define desired output location 
# Note1: This folder will be created if it does not already exists
# Note2: Qlik Sense analysis app must be updated to target same folder 
$OutputFolder="C:\Temp\ProcessUsage\"
